# Project Report: Identify Fraud from Enron Email

## Data set

* No. of data points
* Relation of POI and non-POI
* Number of available features in the original data
* Features with missing values
* Outliers, which and how are they handled?

## Feature selection

* List and explain new features, how they are implemented
* Report on the various feature selection strategies I employed, how each did not improve the results and what I finally came up with (using all features).
* List the different feature scaling methods I tested, explain why SVM benefits from scaled features and why "normal" scaling is used in the final algorithm.

## Algorithms

* Explain which algorithms I tried, create a table to show the different scores they achieved in the default settings.
* Explain how I did parameter tuning.
* Give some more details on the algorithms I investigated (more detailed table).

## Evaluation

* Explain the used evaluation metrics accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score.
* Discuss validation and its importance. Response addresses what validation is and why it is important.
* Explain the StratifiedShuffleSplit strategy and why it was used.
